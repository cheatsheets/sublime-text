* **Extract Partial:** Sh-Alt-P
* **Select Block:** Select similarly indented text Sh + Cmd + J
* **Multiple cursors:** Edit multiple lines of code simultaneously by holding down Cmd and then clicking different lines with your mouse.
* **Reopening closed tabs:** Just as with Chrome, if you accidentally close a file that you&#8217;d like to reopen, just press Shift + Cmd + T. If you keep pressing that key combo, ST will continue opening tabs in the order that you closed them.
* **Quick file opening:** Cmd + T
* **Jumping to symbols:** Cmd + P
* **Search project:** Shift + Cmd + F
* **Jumping between words/lines:** Cmd + arrow keys, you jump from the opposite end of a line.
* **Change settings:** Shift + Cmd + P
* **Jumping between word segments:** Ctrl + arrow keys: to move by word segment - this is camel-case (and underscore) aware.
* **Move current line up/down:** Ctrl + Cmd + Up/Down
* **Quick word editing:** Cmd + d selects the current word. Subsequent Cmd + d presses will select the following instance of the word for editing. Makes it easy to do things such as renaming a local variable or changing both the opening and closing element of a HTML tag.
* **Fine-grained find+replace/modify:** Another one i&#8217;ve found useful is CMD+D / CMD+K+D. CMD+D finds the next instance of the current selection and creates another cursor there (and selects it as well). CMD+K+D skips the current selection and finds the next one.
* **Select all instances:** cmd + ctrl + G
* **Go to a specific line:** ctrl + G
* **Duplicate current line:** cmd + shift + D duplicates line/selected text
